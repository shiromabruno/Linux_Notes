apt
The apt command is a powerful command-line tool, which works with Ubuntu’s Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) performing such functions as installation of new software packages, upgrade of existing software packages, updating of the package list index, and even upgrading the entire Ubuntu system.

ps aux | grep -i apt
check which other process is running the apt command (package manager for handling software)

sudo kill <process_id>
process_id sao (por exemplo) os 4 digitos depois do root da primeira linha

sudo kill -9 <process_id>
force kill

sudo killall apt apt-get
This will kill all the instances of a running program:

sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
Use the lsof command to get the process ID of the process holding the lock files. 
If you see ‘unattende‘ COMMAND column, this means unattended security upgrades are running. You should wait for the process to finish. Basically, this is what I discussed in method 0 but you probably skipped that.
If the COMMAND is something else, you may kill the process and then remove the lock file. You can see the process id under the PID column. Use this PID to kill the process. After that, remove the lock file and run the update command to see if it’s been fixed.
sudo kill -9 PID
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
sudo apt update

sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
safely remove the lock files

sudo dpkg --configure -a
reconfigure the packages
